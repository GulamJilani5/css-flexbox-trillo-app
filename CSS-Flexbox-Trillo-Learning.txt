### solved npm install error(if occurred)
If anyone in 2022 above have a problem related to "npm install" command, 
here's what I do to resolve it. First you need to remove all devDependencies 
line code in package.json and then install it again via command line in vscode.
npm i autoprefixer concat node-sass npm-run-all postcss-cli live-server --save-dev
After that you can run npm run start again


## Defining project settings and custom properties
  09m 45s,  background-repeat: no-repeat;

## Building the overall layout
  -4m 08s, max-width:120rem - 1200px if we have enought space, if view port width is less 
           than max-width will occupy 100% of the view port width.
  -4m 22s,  margin: 8rem auto - centering a div inside it's parent, in my case parent is body.
  -9m 2s,  flex: 0 0 18% - allowing to occupy the 18% of the width.
  -10m 36s,  flex: 1 - allowing to occupy remaining space.

   -7m 52s - Placing the magnifying searching icon on top of the search input field.

## Building the header - Part 3
   -3m 0s - How to place one flex item, out of many, to occupy the full height of the flex container.

   -9m 32s - Centering a text itself based on it's height and width itself.
     1) display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
     2) // display: grid;
       // place-items: center;
  -10m 18s - How to create proper circle

  -2m 8s -  animation on hover with pseudo elements
  -9m 7s -  transform origin property.
