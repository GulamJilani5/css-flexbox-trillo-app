### solved npm install error(if occurred)
If anyone in 2022 above have a problem related to "npm install" command, 
here's what I do to resolve it. First you need to remove all devDependencies 
line code in package.json and then install it again via command line in vscode.
npm i autoprefixer concat node-sass npm-run-all postcss-cli live-server --save-dev
After that you can run npm run start again


## Defining project settings and custom properties
  09m 45s,  background-repeat: no-repeat;

## Building the overall layout
  -4m 08s, max-width:120rem - 1200px if we have enought space, if view port width is less 
           than max-width will occupy 100% of the view port width.

            Easier but sometimes forget how to do because we already placed items into center.

## Building the hotel overview - Part 1
   -2m 30s - How to make responsive images(images fluids). 
             img is inline element and make it block element to avoiding small space underneath the image.
   -11m 30s - sometimes margin-right:auto or margin-left:auto more appropriately fit with flexbox for adjusting spaces
              instead of flex:1. (margin-right: auto; // Or we set to margin-left:auto to "&__location") 

## Building the hotel overview - Part 2
   -2m 12s - svg elements behave like inline elements. we can remove by using line height and fontsize to 0.
             But the simple way is to make a parent element a flexbox. So svg icons will have the exact same height
             as it's content.

   -5m 09s - ## Building the navigation - Part 1 -2m 8s -  fill property of the svg icon with 
                                          currentColor(color of the current color or the parent elements).
          -  currentColor helps to make the text and border the same color in hover as well.
   -6m 30s - ***Required to understanding more.
              background-color: transparent - to different background color on different button.
